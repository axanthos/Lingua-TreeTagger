0.06    2013-01-07
        Applied a patch provided by Alberto Simoes (thanks again!) in order

0.07    2014-11-03
        Fixed TreeTagger.pm to match Moose's new enum definition syntax,

0.08    2015-11-04
        Modified test files to reflect the fact that utf8 parameters are now

        and POD (patches kindly contributed by Alberto Simoes).
